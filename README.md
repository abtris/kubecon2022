| Lightning Talk: Secure Multi User HPC Jobs in Kubernetes with Kyverno - Trey Dockendorf              | Lightning Talk: Secure Multi User HPC Jobs in Kubernetes with Kyverno - Trey Dockendorf, Ohio Supercomputer CenterSites running traditional High Performance Computing workloads are more frequently also deploying Kubernetes for infrastructure. By leveraging the Kubernetes infrastructure, HPC centers can supplement their HPC batch environment with Kubernetes for some very specific use cases, such as interactive HPC jobs. This approach to securely using Kubernetes to support many user’s interactive workloads has been presented and well received at HPC conferences such as Supercomputing 2021. The Ohio Supercomputer Center is currently using Open OnDemand and Kubernetes to securely support virtual classrooms that require running RStudio Server and Jupyter. The benefits of multi-user Kubernetes workloads can also benefit sites who are not traditional HPC but maybe wanting to allow staff a secure place to run containers themselves without necessarily involving the team who maintains Kubernetes.                                                                                                                         | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twOci6ePt7Y | 2022-05-17T20:38:26Z |

I will share the nuances of working together in the community and will focus on areas that need a lot of contributors now especially with the "chop wood and carry water" kind of work that could be easily done by students. I will further focus on how various sigs runs mentoring cohort for contributors to grow up the contributing ladder and learn stuff necessary for taking leadership or helping the leadership, I have been part of such mentoring cohort under sig-contribex and now I'm a moderator of the k-dev mailing list. Also, I will try to focus on how new contributors loose interest while looking for good-first-issues, and I will try to emphasize the importance of regular sig meetings and discussions and help they have helped me to come up with solutions to help the project. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TVPABScDjw | 2022-05-17T20:38:26Z |
| Lightning Talk: Locating and Debugging Failures with Linkerd... Alejandro Pedraza & Edidiong Asikpo  | Lightning Talk: Locating and Debugging Failures with Linkerd and Telepresence - Alejandro Pedraza, Buoyant & Edidiong Asikpo, Ambassador LabsCloud native applications that consist of many services running in K8s clusters can become hard to maintain and evolve. From our experience and what we see in the Kubernetes community Slack channels, when developers hit the tipping point of not being able to run all their services locally, they run into trouble. At this time, they suddenly realize they need new tooling and approaches for observing and debugging applications that will spread across their local dev machines and remote clusters. This presentation will show operators and developers how Linkerd and Telepresence offer a simple way to better observe and debug applications running in their clusters. Easy to follow and replicate (with sample code made available), users will be able to get results quickly, without disrupting their existing services architecture.                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4UFQESXE4 | 2022-05-17T20:38:26Z |
| Lightning Talk: Tell Your SD-WAN About Your Service Mesh External Services! - Alberto Rodriguez      | Lightning Talk: Tell Your SD-WAN About Your Service Mesh External Services! - Alberto Rodriguez, CiscoThis talk shows how with the right configuration and some open source, a Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) can automagically optimize the Egress traffic of a Service Mesh. Using the 'Cloud Native SD-WAN' open-source project, Egress configuration from Service Meshes can now be used to program SD-WAN optimizations towards remote external services.This leverages the 'SaaS optimization' feature offered by several SD-WAN solutions. SaaS optimization enhances connectivity towards SaaS applications (either public SaaS or user-defined remote applications) by constantly probing the remote application from different points of the SD-WAN network to continually compute the best path to reach it.On the Service Mesh side, Egress configurations are used to learn which external services should be probed (and how) to get their traffic optimized. What is typically used to enforce security policies (e.g. allow/deny) can be transposed into traffic engineering optimizations on the SD-WAN.                             | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POEedeeRs_8 | 2022-05-17T20:38:26Z |

| Lightning Talk: What Made Your Container Fat? Visualizing the Size of Container Layers - Dan Čermák  | Lightning Talk: What Made Your Container Fat? Visualizing the Size of Container Layers - Dan Čermák, SUSEThe analysis of container images is becoming increasingly important to deliver a high quality product. We have found it rather challenging to continously monitor the size of our container images that we were producing and existing tools were not focused on data visualization, which we wanted initially. The presented tool was born out of this necessity: it has a very simple user interface, requires no installation (it can be hosted on a server somewhere else) and features sunburst graphs showing the file system usage. This allows everyone to easily check which layer is where responsible for the overall image's size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9wLKRg7ZEw | 2022-05-17T20:38:26Z |

| Lightning Talk: Whyhappn Instead of Whodunnit: Avoiding the Term “Human Error” - Silvia Pina         | Lightning Talk: Whyhappn Instead of Whodunnit: Avoiding the Term “Human Error” - Silvia Pina, IndependentOne of the keys to achieving reliable and secure systems is psychological safety, and this comes from having a truly blameless culture. In the past, I have encountered the term "human error" as the outcome of a "root cause analysis" process, and advocated within the company I was working for against its usage. This is the main motivator for proposing this talk. I would like also to gather some insights, from a systems thinking and organisational psychology standpoint, on how highly resilient organisations in different domains handle the human component of failures, as I think it is useful to have this perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVSN3OW8WAM | 2022-05-17T20:38:26Z |

| Keynote: Why VMware Supports Knative (And Other Cloud Native OSS projects!)- V Körbes, VMware Tanzu  | Keynote: Why VMware Supports Knative (And Other Cloud Native OSS projects!)- V Körbes, VMware TanzuVMware strives to offer our users cloud-neutral, fully-functional solutions with feature parity to cloud-specific, locked-in offerings. Knative, being the strongest alternative to AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, succeeds at that: it provides an avenue for users to deploy that same software/logic but in their own data center or multi-cloud infrastructure.In this session we’ll discuss why the success of open source projects such as Knative is so important: Not only because users are free to use it as they please, but also for being a much more vibrant and quickly-evolving project—something made possible by open source being maintained by a much broader community than any proprietary offering ever could.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AFetTK7nJA | 2022-05-18T22:56:45Z |
| Knative Functions: An Introduction, Demonstration and Roadmap - Lance Ball & Mauricio Salatino       | Knative Functions: An Introduction, Demonstration and Roadmap - Lance Ball, Red Hat (WG lead) & Mauricio Salatino, VMwareKnative Functions fall somewhere between a CaaS (Containers-as-a-Service) and a FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) and provide an experience similar to Google Functions or Azure Container Apps. Those platforms allow you to run your applications without the need to know about containers or Kubernetes. They take source code, often just a function, and convert it into a runnable artifact, deployed on a cluster, while hiding from you all of the Kubernetes and container details. In this talk, you will learn about Knative Functions: what they are; how the project was created and evolved; and most importantly how you can use them to quickly and easily deploy event-driven, Knative Serverless applications. Lance and Mauricio will be live coding to create, build and deploy functions that consume and produce CloudEvents in multiple programming languages, illustrating the polyglot nature of Kubernetes and the Serverless capabilities of Knative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NQAAnZZors | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |
| Data Processing at Scale with Knative and Benthos - Mihai Todor & Murugappan Sevugan Chetty, Box     | Data Processing at Scale with Knative and Benthos - Mihai Todor & Murugappan Sevugan Chetty, BoxKnative serving provides push-based autoscaling (scale based on rps/concurrency) leaving a requirement on a "component" to push these requests. This works well for real-time http/grpc requests. How about event processing and batch processing? For event processing, we could leverage webhooks or knative eventing (different types of sources, brokers, etc). Challenge lies in processing batch data from databases, CSV files, etc. These are common enterprise use cases. To attain auto-scaling for each batch usecase a bespoke component needs to be developed and this is where Benthos shines. Benthos is a stateless data streaming engine that implements transaction-based resiliency with backpressure. When connecting to at-least-once sources and sinks, it's able to guarantee at-least-once delivery without needing to persist messages during transit. Data transformations can be expressed using a DSL. It's a safe, fast, and powerful way to perform document mapping within Benthos. In this session, Mihai and Murugappan will demo how to leverage the best of Knative and Benthos to process data at scale.                                                                                 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdJxJSRf4cg | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |

| Lightning Talk: Docker-free Functions for Knative - Zbynek Roubalik, Red Hat                         | Lightning Talk: Docker-free Functions for Knative - Zbynek Roubalik, Red HatKnative Functions allows developers to build and run their applications on Kubernetes without knowing anything about containers. Instead, the source code is built transparently using a local Docker or Podman installation and deployed as a Knative Service in a few simple steps. Sometimes, however, a local build in Docker or Podman is not possible or simply not the preferred option for a developer. Luckily there is now an alternative. In this lightning talk, Zbynek will present the latest feature of Knative Functions: On-cluster builds, which frees users from creating container images locally. The presentation will describe the different options for creating container images within Kubernetes clusters, the current status, and the plans for on-cluster function builds. A live demo will show the on-cluster builds in action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coq85U24CrQ | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |
| Lightning Talk: What is the Knative Asynchronous Component?- Angelo Danducci II & Michael Maximilien | Lightning Talk: What is the Knative Asynchronous Component? - Angelo Danducci II & Michael Maximilien, IBMCurrently, all Knative services are called in a synchronous fashion. However, in many use cases, a blocking request / response primitive is not sufficient. In particular, for data processing and AI use cases, a blocking invocation approach is sub-optimal. The execution of these services is often long running and surpasses the timeouts for responses, or result in the client having to manage a multitude of pending blocking requests. A more natural invocation pattern is to allow for “fire and forget” or asynchronous invocations, where services are called in an async manner. Doing so allows the client not to block as the service execution is unraveled. The Knative async-component aims to achieve exactly this invocation pattern. Best of all, it does so in a natural and progressive manner that makes any service asynchronous with a simple label and lets the service’s caller decide when to invoke the service synchronously or asynchronously. The project is still in incubation but once it reaches beta-level, we can encourage Knative users with similar async use cases to download and try it in their own Knative clusters.                                            | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KXVbH_Rnvs | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |

Knative brings you flexible consumption-based autoscaling and provides the primitives for creating production-grade event-driven applications. In addition, the command-line tool "kn'' simplifies the Developer workflow with Knative greatly. This presentation takes you through the steps of a typical developer workflow with kn. From the initial, imperative, and iterative creation of services, over GitOps integration into a CI pipeline up to the final production rollout, kn supports all of these stages. Kn also supports kubectl-like plugins for supporting features like connecting to backends like Kafka or a rich Function experience for building Knative services from scratch. After introducing Knative itself, we will show how easy it is to run applications with Knative from the command line with a set of live demos. At the end of this session, we are sure that kn became your new Knative best friend.                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XresRgiVGco | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |
| How We Built an ML inference Platform with Knative - Dan Sun, Bloomberg LP & Animesh Singh, IBM      | How We Built an ML inference Platform with Knative - Dan Sun, Bloomberg LP & Animesh Singh, IBMDeploying and scaling machine learning(ML)- driven applications in production is rarely a simple task. However, serverless inference has been simplified and accelerated through the use of Knative. Knative runs serverless containers on Kubernetes with ease and handles all the details related to networking, requests volume-based autoscaling (including scale-to-zero), and revision tracking. It also enables event-driven applications by integration seamlessly with various event sources.  In this session, the speakers will discuss why their organizations initially chose Knative when building their ML inference platforms, and how these efforts evolved into KServe (github.com/kserve) project. We will also discuss how we leverage Knative to implement blue/green/canary rollout strategies for safe production updates to our ML models, improve GPU utilization with scale-to-zero functionality, and build Apache kafka events-based inference pipeline. At the end of the talk, we will share some of the testing benchmarks (compared with Kubernetes HPA), as well as performance optimization tips that have enabled us to run hundreds to thousands of Knative services in a single cluster. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuxC1UVU_ec | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |
| How Fast is FaaS? Reducing Cold Start Times in Knative - Paul Schweigert & Carlos Santana, IBM       | How Fast is FaaS? Reducing Cold Start Times in Knative - Paul Schweigert & Carlos Santana, IBMKnative is used to build serverless-style systems. One of the key features of these systems is the ability to scale a service up/down on demand, only running pods when they are needed to handle a request. When scaling up, however, users are likely to encounter the “cold start” problem, whereby the latency of when a new pod is ready to handle requests is non-negligible (2-5 seconds or more). Scheduling and making a Pod available in Kubernetes fast enough to provide a FaaS (Function as a Service) experience is a problem that we face today as it involves many components and orchestration. In this talk, Paul and Carlos will discuss how autoscaling works in Knative, the cold start problem space, and the steps taken by Knative to reduce container startup latency. One innovative solution is to pause the container CPU while maintaining state, this will allow for a fast response by having warm containers available and orchestrated. This is a practice typically used in FaaS systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-TkMOM0bk | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |

| Lightning Talk: Modernizing Your IBM-MQ Applications with Knative and Kong - Sebastien Goasguen      | Lightning Talk: Modernizing Your IBM-MQ Applications with Knative and Kong - Sebastien Goasguen, TriggerMeshIBM MQ has long been at the core of many enterprise applications especially those using mainframes. Enterprises are trying to extend the lifetime and relevance of such legacy systems in a Cloud-Native era by linking them with containerized workloads. Legacy applications still heavily rely on these systems and second, they cannot be easily replaced by Cloud solutions. In this talk we will show how you can bridge the two worlds of old legacy systems and modern Cloud architecture. We will make use of a Kong API gateway, Knative and some TriggerMesh components for event transformation and connection with IBM-MQ. We will take the example of a Mulesoft application that exposes a REST API in front of a mainframe system of record and we will decompose it using an event-driven system built on containers and using Knative and TriggerMesh. This will show how you can keep using your IBM MQ system but usher into a more open source and cloud-native world which speeds up your application workflow and reduces cost.                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsnMZ6ogPEY | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |

While highlighting one useful use-case, the talk will go into more details on what it took to add support for streaming events using Knative instead of Apache Kafka, as well as some of the caveats and pitfalls to beware of if you are also looking at how to convert your microservices into a Knative enabled service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuJCJfLNYbc | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |
| Connecting the World to Knative with Kamelets - Roland Huß, Red Hat                                  | Connecting the World to Knative with Kamelets - Roland Huß, Red HatIn Knative Eventing, sources are responsible for importing events from the outside world, converting them to CloudEvents, and sending them along to a Knative sink. But creating source support for a backend requires a considerable amount of effort and additional installation steps on your cluster. Kamelets are a new technology that provides a solution for this problem: they are general-purpose connectors from the Apache Camel ecosystem that are ready to use within Knative. Apache Camel is the prevalent open-source enterprise application integration framework that provides connectors to more than 300 systems. This presentation explains how to use Kamelets as event sources in Knative and connect them to your applications. You will learn to install Kamelet support on your cluster, discover Kamelets from a catalog, and how to deploy and manage them with a Knative client plugin or directly with YAML resources. In a live demo, we will see the combination of Kamelets and Knative in action. Get ready and join the camel caravan to connect the world to your event-driven applications!                                                                                                                         | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abxp_HW6lJE | 2022-05-17T21:10:57Z |

William will cover all the uninteresting things happening in this boring project and discuss some of its profoundly non-exciting approaches to some perfectly ordinary challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBVUScYUiYo | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Keynote: Expanding the 80/20 Rule for Creating Service Mesh Value- Idit Levine, Solo.io              | Keynote: Expanding the 80/20 Rule for Creating Service Mesh Value- Idit Levine, Solo.ioWhile service mesh usage continues to grow, far too many companies are only seeing value from mTLS and observability. 80% of their value comes from 20% of the capabilities. As we connect and secure the world’s modern applications, we must strive to bring value to a broader set of use-cases. This means not only improving the performance and simplifying operations, but also exposing more of the value of service mesh to application teams, security teams, and ultimately to the forefront of the business.In her talk, Idit Levine, CEO of Solo.io, will discuss innovative use cases that can be enabled by extending a service mesh. She will explore how the flexibility of mesh architectures can be used to enable more flexible, more secure, and more powerful usage patterns for companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKwcBRGS5fM | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |

In this talk we'll explore extending the mesh beyond Kubernetes to the variety of compute and runtimes we see composed to form modern enterprise applications. By bringing these environments and services into the mesh, we can provide a unified application network that handles cross-cutting connectivity and security concerns for developers in our organization, enabling them to focus on building their applicationsService Mesh Everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU-0n_1uQS8 | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Multi-region Service Mesh: How Koyeb Built and Operates One Using Kuma and Envoy - Yann Léger, Koyeb | Multi-region Service Mesh: How Koyeb Built and Operates One Using Kuma and Envoy - Yann Léger, KoyebService mesh is all over the place but how do you build and operate a service mesh across regions and at scale? This talk will cover how Koyeb, a serverless cloud provider, built a globally distributed mesh to provide easy-to-use inter-service connectivity across multiple cloud providers and continents. To achieve this, they built a custom stack with a multi-region service mesh using Kuma, which is an open-source control plane for service mesh orchestrating Envoy proxies. Yann will walk you through how they built distributed connectivity inside the platform, the key decisions they had to make, and what their architecture looks like. They now have a purpose-built stack based on Nomad, Firecracker, and Kuma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB93WCoroL8 | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Shh, It is A Secret: Manage Your Workload Certs in Service Mesh without Persisting any Se... Lin Sun | Shh, It is A Secret: Manage Your Workload Certs in Service Mesh without Persisting any Secrets- Lin Sun, Solo.ioMost service mesh projects provide self signed CA but that is NON-STARTER for a production environment as most organizations already have their PKI system in place before they adopt any service mesh. While many service mesh projects have added the support for plugging in your intermediate CA or external PKI system, they however require persisting the intermediate or root CA’s private key as Kubernetes secrets which is a security concern for them. This talk discusses a few innovative approaches in the service mesh community to tackle this challenge and the tradeoffs among them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsyTjSZ16IY | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Lightning Talk: Move Over API Gateway.... into Your Service Mesh- Marino Wijay, Solo.io              | Lightning Talk: Move Over API Gateway.... into Your Service Mesh- Marino Wijay, Solo.ioThey say API Gateways are for your "north-south" traffic into your clusters and Service Mesh is for your "east-west" traffic. Is this really the case? As you deploy a service mesh for high availability, failover, and tenancy, you will find north/south and east/west start to converge. Instead of thinking of API Gateways and Service Mesh as separate and different, we should be thinking of them as the same thing. In this talk, we explore the role of modern API gateway and how we can make it part of the service mesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyLOmlII5gQ | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Protocol Detection: A Deep Dive into How Linkerd Achieves Zero-Config - Kevin Leimkuhler, Buoyant    | Protocol Detection: A Deep Dive into How Linkerd Achieves Zero-Config - Kevin Leimkuhler, BuoyantZero-config is one of Linkerd's claims to fame: for (most) Kubernetes apps, adding Linkerd doesn't require user config, even if the app uses arbitrary TCP protocols which Linkerd must proxy in a fully transparent manner. The use of protocol detection automatically determines the protocol based on the data on the connection. Linkerd maintainer Kevin Leimkuhler will describe the mechanics of how Linkerd's protocol detection works, covering the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation, including so-called server-speaks-first protocols and why they need to be handled differently. He'll also cover how the implementation has evolved over the years as Linkerd adoption has grown to encompass even more types of applications and protocols, including the introduction of "skip ports" and "opaque ports". Finally, attendees will learn how opaque ports are implemented in the proxy using ALPN, and how Linkerd is still able to provide mTLS and golden metrics for this type of traffic. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBH-v9mJ3bU | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Lightning Talk: Multi-cluster Istio Mesh – Complex or Piece of Cake? - Laszlo Bence Nagy, Cisco      | Lightning Talk: Multi-cluster Istio Mesh – Complex or Piece of Cake? - Laszlo Bence Nagy, CiscoSetting up and then preserving a multi-cluster Istio mesh is cumbersome today, as it involves several manual steps. Those steps are not automatic, because there is no continuous synchronization mechanism between the participating clusters. With the open-source Cisco (formerly Banzai Cloud) Istio operator, forming and then sustaining a multi-cluster Istio mesh is almost fully automated. It is made possible by utilizing a cluster registry controller component, which provides continuous synchronization for the necessary resources between the clusters. In this session, you will learn: - How to form a multi-cluster mesh with ease - Learn how the necessary resources are synced between the clusters - Understand how the system recovers even when network endpoints are changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZlHZtcTfYg | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |

| Lightning Talk: GitOps and Controllers: It’s Not That Simple for Multi-cluster- Alex Ly, Solo.io     | Lightning Talk: GitOps and Controllers: It’s Not That Simple for Multi-cluster- Alex Ly, Solo.ioGitOps has become a valuable approach to manage configuration for applications and infrastructure. Having a source of truth that can be automated, auditable, and is easy to understand is increasingly important when expanding to many deployments. However, enabling multi-cluster capabilities typically presents new challenges: not every cluster is the same, context is important, and managing every lower- level configuration across multiple environments can get cumbersome (and dangerous) quickly. This talk will focus on a specific example where multi-cluster GitOps is difficult: application-networking and security with service mesh. The goal is for platform teams to provide the right point of demarcation with abstractions that focus on the intent, while abstracting away the translation and orchestration of lower-level config (mesh-specific API resources in this case). We share our experiences building these abstractions with some of the largest deployments of service mesh in the world. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSVBLjcbmzY | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Tune Your Service Mesh - Mohammad Reza Saleh Sedghpour, Umeå University                              | Tune Your Service Mesh - Mohammad Reza Saleh Sedghpour, Umeå UniversityService meshes improve developer productivity by factoring out cloud native patterns such as retry mechanism, circuit breaking, etc. into a unified network control plane. Modern cloud platform adopters realized how tough the tuning of these patterns can be in a highly interdependent and dynamic microservice architecture and how improper configuration of such patterns can reduce throughput and/or increase the response time. This talk will discuss the pitfalls of configuring circuit breaking and retry mechanisms in a multi-tier application using Istio. It will help you configure your environment systematically to enhance the performance of your application from an end-to-end perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KhxgU0eBGA | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |
| Unleash Declarative Data Access with GraphQL- Kevin Dorosh & Sai Ekbote, Solo.io                     | Unleash Declarative Data Access with GraphQL- Kevin Dorosh & Sai Ekbote, Solo.ioGraphQL is redefining the way that developers interact with APIs, putting application clients in control of the data they consume and placing new requirements on the platforms hosting these APIs. Understanding when to write code and when to let the platform do the work is a critical tradeoff to understand as you scale GraphQL adoption. In this talk, Kevin and Sai will share experience building GraphQL support directly into Envoy to support edge gateway and service mesh use cases. They will cover common deployment patterns, GraphQL-specific implications to security and policy controls, instrumenting existing mesh services (REST, gRPC, SOAP, Lambda) with GraphQL, and the benefits and tradeoffs between declarative and programmatic approaches to GraphQL composition. This will be a hands-on session with live demos and real talk, focused on patterns of adoption to easily implement GraphQL at scale.

| Tidy Up Microservices Connectivity with Apache Kafka® and Kuma - Danica Fine & Viktor Gamov          | Tidy Up Microservices Connectivity with Apache Kafka® and Kuma - Danica Fine, Confluent & Viktor Gamov, KongGiven the rising popularity of microservice-based architectures, Kubernetes has solidified itself as one of the most dominant container management systems available on the market. That said, deploying a host of RESTful/HTTP/gRPC services on Kubernetes has not been historically easy or efficient. Enter: service mesh. The service mesh easily facilitates the communication of synchronous microservices over a network. Leveraging an asynchronous communication method – such as that provided by Apache Kafka® messaging – may complicate things. Over the course of this presentation, Danica and Viktor will explore how to deploy Kafka-based microservices – including vanilla Kafka and Kafka Connect components – together with Kuma. We’ll also discuss the benefits and relevance of this particular approach.                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzgZwjzzcXo | 2022-05-17T22:22:04Z |

Getting access to powerful Kernel capabilities can be extremely powerful, especially in networking, but what is the responsibility of this layer when it comes to service mesh? In this talk we discuss the importance of separation of layers, where eBPF fits for service mesh (and where it doesn't), and how to best optimize the service mesh architecture and experience for the real problems users have: security, observability, flexible policy enforcement, and overall traffic management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heDVglDRDNw | 2022-05-19T13:17:19Z |
| Cilium Service Mesh - Thomas Graf, Isovalent                                                         | eBPF is a powerful Linux kernel technology that is used in several CNCF projects to provide faster networking, new security applications, and deeper observability. In this talk, we explore how eBPF, using the Cilium project, allows you to build a service mesh entirely without sidecars while still relying on proven Envoy proxy technology. We will look at how moving service mesh functionality into the kernel using eBPF leads to massive performance gains and simplification of the overall model while remaining compatible with existing control planes. Service mesh will become invisible at the kernel level similar to how namespaces, the foundation of containers, are invisible today. The sidecar-free model unlocks a simpler architecture, performance gains, scalability advantages, and even more transparency to applications. Together, we will look at the new architecture, compare performance numbers, and run through a demo.                                                                                                                                                                     | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpwTkm53YTY | 2022-05-19T13:17:19Z |

| Sponsored Keynote - Connecting Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Data for Faster Troublesho... Ramon Guiu | Sponsored Keynote - Connecting Prometheus and OpenTelemetry Data for Faster Troubleshooting - Ramon Guiu, VP of Observability, TimescaleThe last few years have been fantastic for observability practitioners with the growth of Prometheus as the standard for metrics monitoring and the emergence of OpenTelemetry as a standard for application monitoring. Interoperability is key for standards to be adopted and successful. In this case, these two standards can make it easier for engineers to both instrument their systems and troubleshoot problems faster. In this talk, we will show the true power of Prometheus and OpenTelemetry working together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2-iGDeKdOw | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |
| Prometheus Data analysis and Event Notifications for Progressive Delivery - Ravi Hari, Intuit        | Prometheus Data analysis and Event Notifications for Progressive Delivery - Ravi Hari, IntuitPrometheus is a defacto monitoring tool in kubernetes. Argo Rollouts is an open source kubernetes controller provides ways to perform analysis to drive progressive delivery in kubernetes using Prometheus. While it is crucial to do the analysis it is also important to send the notification of analysis status to the user in near real time. Argo Rollouts uses notification engine which will trigger notifications based on a successful or failure status of analysis using Prometheus data. In this talk we will walk you through an example of how an application can be configured using argo-rollouts by using analysis templates that rely on Prometheus and use notification templates to send notifications in real time to the user. This will also show how this can be integrated to multiple notification channels, destinations and recipients on analysis status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1gU_grkRxA | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |

| How Prometheus indexes Data and Why You Should Care - Harkishen Singh, Timescale                     | How Prometheus indexes Data and Why You Should Care - Harkishen Singh, TimescalePrometheus is capable of ingesting and storing large amounts of metric samples. Prometheus users define queries and dashboards to extract insights from all that data that help them ensure their systems are up and performing as expected. Good query performance is important and that’s why Prometheus indexes incoming data. In this talk we will dive into how Prometheus indexes incoming data. We will aim to give you a visual understanding of the on-disk layout and data structures used to store samples. The aim is to develop an intuitive understanding of data access complexity and costs. This will inform you about how to manage cardinality and how PromQL queries leverage the index to speed up query execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSpBpVvgRxk | 2022-05-19T11:41:12Z |
| Fleeting Metrics: Monitoring Short-lived or Serverless Jobs... Bartłomiej Płotka & Saswata Mukherjee | Fleeting Metrics: Monitoring Short-lived or Serverless Jobs with Prometheus - Bartłomiej Płotka & Saswata Mukherjee, Red HatPrometheus is the leading open-source monitoring solution when it comes to metrics and alerting. It is a single binary that provides you with all you need to monitor your infrastructure and services. It has seen the shift from on-prem to cloud environments and has proven to be successful for users with all kinds of use cases. Prometheus was always designed to aggregate long-living metrics. However, this does not always go along with the solutions that are emerging in the CNCF ecosystem. Short-living workloads are increasingly common in form of Kubernetes batch jobs and serverless platforms like OpenFaas or Lambda and many more. This leads to the question, how and if we can use Prometheus to monitor and troubleshoot those kinds of jobs? In this talk, you will learn about the potential solutions that are emerging in the Prometheus ecosystem. Bartek and Saswata will dive into this problem and propose a set of solutions that could help in monitoring those short-living workloads using the Prometheus data model. The audience will see a demonstration of a solution that uses best practices to capture fleeting metrics and integrates them with Prometheus. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt4JiK995s8 | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |
| How and Why We Rebuilt Auto-scaling in OpenFaaS with Prometheus - Alex Ellis, OpenFaaS Ltd           | How and Why We Rebuilt Auto-scaling in OpenFaaS with Prometheus - Alex Ellis, OpenFaaS LtdIn the Six Million Dollar Man we get the quote “We can rebuild him. We have the technology. We can make him better than he was. Better, stronger, faster.” And with that in mind, prompted by customer feedback we rebuilt the subsystem responsible for scaling OpenFaaS functions. The new and improved version serves the needs of customers better - with the added ability to scale on in-flight requests and CPU (as well as RPS). This wasn’t an easy journey and we think you’ll be able to learn from some of the PromQL we wrote, how we (instrument) collect the data and the issues we ran into along the way. There’ll be PromQL samples, live demos of scaling functions linked back to end-user use-cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka5QjX0JgFo | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |
| Warp-Speed Debugging with Prometheus Exemplars - Ian Billett, Red Hat                                | Warp-Speed Debugging with Prometheus Exemplars - Ian Billett, Red HatEffectively debugging distributed systems almost always requires inspecting more than just your Prometheus metrics data - logs, traces and profiles all provide essential information that help you quickly and efficiently pinpoint the root cause of your bugs. However, navigating between different systems with disjointed data sources interrupts your debugging flow state and ultimately increases the time taken to identify and resolve your bugs. Wouldn't it be nice if Prometheus had a native capability to help you hop between data sources? Enter exemplars! In this beginner-focused talk, Ian Billett will walk you through what exemplars are, how they work and provide practical examples of how you can leverage them in your applications today to super charge your debugging experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBvU_3IeK4k | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |
| Storing Continuous Benchmarking Data in Prometheus - Matvey Arye, TimescaleDB/Promscale              | Storing Continuous Benchmarking Data in Prometheus - Matvey Arye, TimescaleDB/PromscalePrometheus is most commonly used for observing live production systems. In this talk, we’ll cover another great use case: benchmarking. Usually, distributed systems are benchmarked by using a benchmark driver to apply load and measure performance. This is typically the only data recorded for the benchmark. The problem with this approach is that it gives you visibility into performance output but no ability to diagnose why performance issues occurred. By using Prometheus in your performance benchmarks you can measure resource usage metrics and internal application metrics across all your components giving you the insights you need to understand the reason for performance issues so you can fix them. This will not require a lot of additional effort because you can reuse the observability infrastructure that you should already be implementing in your application as well as the dashboards already built into Grafana. It also allows retrospective analysis of benchmark runs since the data is stored in Prometheus. In this talk we’ll explain how we set up such an environment as well as share lessons learned about tracking benchmarking runs and keeping the result data organized.               | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yj2pSfsu8I | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |

| Lightning Talk: Integrating 3rd Party, Non-prometheus-native Services without Writing... Paweł Krupa | Lightning Talk: Integrating 3rd Party, Non-prometheus-native Services without Writing Code - Paweł Krupa, TimescaleMany SaaS offerings provide services from which it might be good to collect data with prometheus either for easy data correlation or for alerting. However, not many of those services offer data in prometeus format. In this talk, I'll go through a simple setup that uses json_exporter to gather prometheus data from free service (uptimerobot) exposing JSON API to provide synthetic monitoring functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpTvql1u8qk | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |
| Lightning Talk: Easy anomaly Detection with PromQL - David de Torres Huerta, Sysdig                  | Lightning Talk: Easy anomaly Detection with PromQL - David de Torres Huerta, SysdigHow to create an alert on a service whose load changes over the different hours of a day? How can I alert on a process that has different usage over different days of a week? Anomaly detection is one of the main challenges that Prometheus users face while setting up alerts. Systems are usually dynamic and the use of resources and behavior depends on external factors that vary over time. Setting up alerts with static thresholds in these environments generates a lot of noise, causing alert fatigue in the operators and ignoring important notifications camouflaged among false positives. In this talk, we will see the different kinds of anomaly detection, when to use them and how to implement them in promQL. Although PromQL does not have specific functions for anomaly detection, as it has for linear regression, it does provide the building blocks to create different kinds of anomaly detection. We will also discuss the possibility of creating new PromQL functions that would make it easier to create this kind of anomaly detection alert.                                                                                                                                                                 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vxR9Rb5bBU | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |

| Lightning Talk: Monitoring Counter Strike Global offensive with Prometheus - David Lorite, Sysdig    | Lightning Talk: Monitoring Counter Strike Global offensive with Prometheus - David Lorite, SysdigEveryone is using Prometheus in their infrastructure, but who is using Prometheus in their game server? In gaming, servers are a critical component of the industry's success. The gaming industry is highly profitable and the enabling technology is critical to its success. They also carry a great responsibility in maintaining quality of service (QoS), where a drop in the latency or in the computing power, especially in multiplayer games, seriously affects user experience. can be critical. In this talk, you will learn how to set up and monitor a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive server with Prometheus. We will show the installation and configuration of the Prometheus server and the following exporters: - Node exporter: to monitor the infrastructure metrics. - CAdvisor: to monitor the usage of the containers. - SRCDS Exporter: to monitor the game server metrics. With all these exporters, apart from monitoring the game itself, we will have visibility into the node and the applications on it, to be sure that the VM is running everything at an optimal service level and avoids extra costs in our cloud bill.                                                                            | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uLA5RtZ4TE | 2022-05-17T22:08:00Z |

Matthias Loibl | Lightning Talk: Pyrra - Making SLOs with Prometheus Manageable, Accessible, and Easy to Use for Everyone! - Matthias Loibl, Polar SignalsIn this lightning talk Matthias will give an introduction to Pyrra, a project that aims to make Service Level Objectives (SLOs) with Prometheus manageable, accessible, and easy to use for everyone. Matthias will walk you through some examples for creating a error ratio SLO and a latency SLO. We will then briefly look at Pyrra's architecture and how the critical path of alerting is still done by Prometheus. After this talk you will be confident to start to implementing SLOs in your organization with an open source project that builds on the beloved open source project Prometheus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ox0M6HIE3w | 2022-05-19T12:04:57Z |
| Alerting and Anomaly Detection – Best Friends Forever? - Björn Rabenstein, Grafana Labs              | Alerting and Anomaly Detection – Best Friends Forever? - Björn Rabenstein, Grafana LabsWhen Prometheus became publicly known starting in 2015, the Prometheus developers expected many questions. But one surprisingly stuck out: “Can you do anomaly detection?” Somehow, everyone expected a next-generation monitoring and alerting system to venture into anomaly detection. PromQL is powerful enough to support fundamental building blocks of anomaly detection, but the general direction of Promethean alerting is, in a way, exactly the opposite: Towards confident, non-noisy alerts based on your SLOs. In this talk, Beorn will share a few stories from the receiving end of the pager and why it is almost always a bad idea to put anomaly detection at the other end. He will talk about the “proper” Promethean way of alerting (including its limitations) and where anomaly detection (or even machine learning) might have its place in it after all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3s03RHidf8 | 2022-05-19T12:04:57Z |

| Monitoring Fluent Bit in Production - Pandu Aji, Microsoft                                           | Monitoring Fluent Bit in Production - Pandu Aji, MicrosoftFluent Bit comes with built-in features to allow you to query internal information and monitor metrics of each running plugin. But how do you decide which metrics to use for measuring the reliability of your pipeline? How do you leverage the storage metrics, and what are the challenges? How do you detect if your logging pipeline is unhealthy and if there is any congestion? This talk will describe our Fluent Bit monitoring story. It will briefly touch on some of the design choices but will primarily focus on how to monitor Fluent Bit in the production clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhlyY6glf0A | 2022-05-16T20:04:17Z |
| Lightning Talk: Data Flow Control in Cluster Logging Pipeline - Pranjal Gupta & Eran Raichstein, IBM | Lightning Talk: Data Flow Control in Cluster Logging Pipeline - Pranjal Gupta & Eran Raichstein, IBMLogging pipelines are crucial in ensuring container logs are reliably collected and routed to persistent storage. Logs generated by workloads (container processes) are written to files by Container Monitor processes (e.g. Conmon). In production environments, as Fluentd deals with a massive volume of logs, the log generation rate often exceeds the rate of log collection, which causes log loss. There is a need to prioritise application logs so that administrators can collect logs from high priority workloads in a controlled manner. In this talk, we introduce a new feature in the in_tail input plugin, which uses group rules to rate limit log collection. We share exciting insights from our systematic study about log loss on Fluentd plugins using our open-source benchmarking framework. We also present a Log Flow Control framework that allows users to define and enforce log rate limit policies to control log loss predictably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmQBQBMjqsQ | 2022-05-16T20:04:17Z |

| Demystify the Fluent Core Event Loop and Join in on its Optimization Efforts - Matthew Fala, Amazon  | Demystify the Fluent Core Event Loop and Join in on its Optimization Efforts - Matthew Fala, AmazonAt the most fundamental level, Fluent Bit is an event driven system that relies on a core event loop running on each thread to initiate, resume, and clean routines required for delivering data. Have the core Fluent Bit event loop demystified, and deep dive into the data uncovering existing problems that occur due to the event loop in high throughput use-cases. The talk brings you into the community discussion on how to best optimize this event loop system and uncovers efforts spent on implementing the identified improvements. For the sake of understandably, a highly correlated analogy will be conveyed to modal the central concepts (the event loop, coroutines, cpu, yield, ready list, blocking wait) providing means to think through event loop problems and ideate solutions conceptually without full knowledge of unrelated systems. Attendees should after the talk be able to: 1. Understand the Event Loop system conceptually 2. Gain insight into the conceptual problems of the Event Loop system 3. Gain insight into the currently proposed conceptual solutions 4. Have the knowledge and tools to join the discussion, and propose new solutions. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB27FO4uxgE | 2022-05-16T20:04:17Z |
| Challenges of Logging on the Edge - Mickey Pashov, Medtronic Digital Surgery                         | Challenges of Logging on the Edge - Mickey Pashov, Medtronic Digital SurgeryIn this talk we will describe our journey from arbitrary log collection from edge devices to building an observability pipeline with FluentBit. We will discuss the reasons why we chose it over other agents - highly performant with a small memory footprint, open-source, vendor-agnostic, great community support, extensibility via Lua filters, and a plethora of core input and output plugins. Some of the challenges of deploying on-prem such as firewall and web filter rules; authN and authZ to the cloud; offline-mode and packaging and deployment using an unfamiliar toolchain. We will also discuss the the challenges of deploying an observability pipeline on Kubernetes with FluentD. From setting up the Helm charts and livenessProbes to TLS termination and autoscaling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMJjv-2d7qs | 2022-05-16T20:04:17Z |
| Modernizing to the Fluent Stack: An Asana Story - James Elías Sigurðarson, Asana                     | Modernizing to the Fluent Stack: An Asana Story - James Elías Sigurðarson, AsanaIn 2021, Asana migrated its event emission infrastructure to use Fluent Bit, from an old logging system based on Facebook's Scribe. At Asana, event emission requires high flexibility, performance, and durability, as it powers important Asana features, such as mobile notifications. In this session, we'll take a look at how we modernised our infrastructure, and used the Fluent Node library to meet these challenges, eventually scaling up to 3.5 billion events per day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZE_RiyFqyM | 2022-05-16T20:04:17Z |

| Securing Fluent Bit by Way of Fuzzing - David Korczynski, Ada Logics                                 | Securing Fluent Bit by Way of Fuzzing - David Korczynski, Ada LogicsThis talk will cover efforts in automating security and reliability analysis of Fluent Bit by way of fuzzing. Fuzzing is an automated testing technique that is used in combination with bug sanitizers to identify code issues in software. In the last two years David has set up extensive continuous fuzzing of Fluent Bit by way of the open source fuzzing service OSS-Fuzz, and in this talk David will present details of this work and the results achieved, and also highlight how this impacts the overall security of Fluent Bit. The talk will cover the implementation of automated testing, the bugs found and various related statistics. The talk will relate the efforts in automated security testing onto how it impacts the security posture of Fluent Bit at large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp6IClswWQE | 2022-05-20T11:36:26Z |

| Keynote: DevSecOps and the Art of Not Ending Up On the Front Page- Fabio Rapposelli, VMware Tanzu    | Keynote: DevSecOps and the Art of Not Ending Up On the Front Page- Fabio Rapposelli, VMware TanzuDevSecOps is the seamless and transparent integration of security into emerging agile IT and DevOps development. Ideally, this is accomplished without reducing developers' agility or speed or requiring them to leave their development toolchain environment. The SolarWinds Supply-Chain Attack is one of the most dangerous in recent memory. The malware was distributed as part of an update and was digitally signed by a valid digital certificate containing the company's name. The software bill of materials (SBOM) is gaining new attention and notoriety in the aftermath of SolarWinds. Requiring SBOMs for all software entering your pipeline has become common sense. And in some cases it’s a mandate. For example, Executive Order 14028 requires an SBOM for all federal software procurements in the United States.At the moment, less than half of companies create SBOMs for their software, and accountability for SBOMs appears to be lost in a rush to deliver new software. Understanding which components are included in applications is critical for proactive vulnerability management. The SBOM is a versatile and adaptable approach that can be easily tailored to specific use cases. What should you put in SBOMs for software applications that your company makes, buys, or consumes? | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSlise4jILY | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |

| Security Champions: The What, Why, and How - Ann Marie Fred, Red Hat                                 | Security Champions: The What, Why, and How - Ann Marie Fred, Red HatKnown vulnerabilities are a fact of life, especially with open source software. Cyber Security Intelligence tracked over 18,000 CVEs and at least 66 Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in 2021. According to the Sonatype 2020 DevSecOps Community Survey, 24% of organizations surveyed revealed a breach within one of their web applications in the prior 12 months. The average cost of a data breach was $4.24 million, according to the IBM 2021 Cost of a Data Breach Report. The only way to keep up with the fast pace and demands of cybersecurity today is to scale up the security expertise of your technical workforce. This talk explains why setting up a Security Champions program is such an important part of an overall cybersecurity strategy. Then it goes into detail on how to get your own Security Champions program running, the realistic costs of such a program, and what benefits you can expect from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baudGw99ges | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |
| Protect the Pipe! A Policy-based Approach for Securing CI/CD Pipe... Shripad Nadgowda & Jim Bugwadia | Protect the Pipe! A Policy-based Approach for Securing CI/CD Pipelines - Shripad Nadgowda, IBM Research & Jim Bugwadia, NirmataModern applications are composed of hundreds of packages and delivered to production via automated CI/CD pipelines. With rapid delivery comes the growing risk of attacks, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. Protecting these critical assets requires policy-based controls for CI/CD pipeline composition, configurations and execution. In this session, Shripad and Jim will present a cloud-native security framework for Tekton pipelines using in-toto, Kyverno and sigstore. They will discuss the unique security challenges for CI/CD pipelines, and then demonstrate the use of open-source tools to attest and verify each pipeline resource and execution step using declarative policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVkumUImIao | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |

It has implementations in python, go, and rust that have been used in production by organizations like Datadog, AWS BottleRocket, Google Fuchsia, and Sigstore. Panelists will provide insight into the state of the project, how TUF can be used to improve supply chain security, and behind the scenes perspectives on integrations with Sigstore and PyPI. The panelists will also speak on unique challenges around maintenance, vulnerability disclosure and consumption of an open source project with multiple implementations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCTKc8mke8o | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |
| Lightning Talks: Detecting Data Exfiltration on the Edge with Pixie - Zain Asgar, New Relic          | Lightning Talks: Detecting Data Exfiltration on the Edge with Pixie - Zain Asgar, New RelicDetecting data exfiltration in your Kubernetes cluster is important but hard. Capturing the right data, especially encrypted data, in order to perform the analysis can be a hassle. Additionally, it can be a non-starter to export sensitive requests outside of the cluster to perform this analysis. In this lightning talk, you’ll learn how Pixie (an open source, CNCF sandbox project), can be applied to attack this problem. Pixie’s auto-telemetry, in-cluster edge compute, and scriptability make it a powerful tool for anyone looking to identify data exfiltration attacks in their cluster. We’ll show a demo which will also be open source for attendees to reference later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzZW4JEOE-0 | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |
| Lightning Talk: What’s Inside Your Container Image? How to Audit All the Dependencies... Steve Judd  | Lightning Talk: What’s Inside Your Container Image? How to Audit All the Dependencies in Your software Supply-Chain. - Steve Judd, JetstackThis year has seen much focus on software supply chains and how organisations can move towards a zero trust approach, especially with regards to the 3rd-party artefacts they depend on. Yet a security gap still exists that is preventing organisations from knowing the provenance of their 3rd party software components. This is because the vast majority of build systems (both cloud-hosted and on-premise) do not directly provide the features necessary to achieve even the minimum SLSA Levels. This talk will describe how Jetstack worked with Improbable Defence to design and implement a framework to evaluate all the Images in use across all environments, and seamlessly map each one to known associated vulnerabilities and open-source licences. Assessing Images in this manner has allowed Improbable Defence to keep an accurate inventory and implement admission policies to prevent Images that don’t meet their risk posture from being used. The result is a fine-grained operational security framework which profiles the provenance of each 3rd party component and builds a comprehensive security posture across the supply chain.                                                                                                             | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lpy3Ze8aEc | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |
| Using CNCF Best Practices for Software Supply Chain to Guide and Enha... Ryan Gibbons & Conor Rogers | Using CNCF Best Practices for Software Supply Chain to Guide and Enhance Your Security Posture - Ryan Gibbons, 3m & Conor Rogers, StelligentIn this presentation the 3M team will describe how CNCF best practices were used to inform requirements for secure software development capabilities throughout the 3M software supply chain and our journey to improve the code security posture. The team will describe how CNCF best practices were used to evangelize an improved security policy and inform Security, Legal, Risk and Delivery Management functions. Using the CNCF best practices the 3M team will tell the story of how these best practices were used to enhance policy, process, procedure and build across the Software Development Lifecycle. We will tell our story of Securing The Software Supply Chain with a particular emphasis on Opensource Components and we will share how our efforts to date have helped the organization to respond to and prepare for Supply Chain Attacks and vulnerabilities such as Log4J. Finally we will hope to help the community on accelerating their journey to the standards based SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sfv83CsCao | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |
| The Unexpected Demise of Open Source Libraries - Liran Tal, Synk                                     | The Unexpected Demise of Open Source Libraries - Liran Tal, SynkHello there dear developer building your app on open source dependencies. Oh wait, did you think open source code lives forever? Think again! Did you hear about the maintainer discontinuing a library despite having tens of millions of downloads? What about a maintainer who intentionally introduced code to break the functionality of his package which receives millions of downloads? So, did you ever wonder why dependencies die? Join me on a journey full of humor and horror across real-world incidents to learn how even the mightiest of open source projects got defeated. What can we learn from past incidents on the continuous struggles of open source software sustainability, maintainer burnout, and how it impacts us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD43KJx15GY | 2022-05-16T22:40:52Z |

| Vanquishing Vulnerabilities in Valencia - Alba Ferri Fitó, Sysdig & Eric Smalling, Synk              | Vanquishing Vulnerabilities in Valencia - Alba Ferri Fitó, Sysdig & Eric Smalling, SynkThe infamous Log4Shell vulnerability took us all by surprise right as we were preparing to take our end-of-year vacations! Will there be another massive vulnerability to deal with this year? It’s very possible, but you can be ready for it! Join us to learn how you can prepare your organization for the next critical CVE and make it harder for attackers to leverage it against you. From the developers’ shell to runtime in production, there are many tools and practices you can put in place today that can mitigate and detect would-be attackers and make their lives harder. Topics will include container image construction and scanning, policy enforcement, controlling network traffic, safer runtime configurations, and monitoring runtime behavior. This session will include live demonstrations of the log4shell remote code exploit and how effective the techniques presented can be against attacks on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK-mlDm_yRE | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |
| Shrinking Software Attack Surface with WebAssembly & CNCF Wasmcloud - Liam Randall, Cosmonic         | Shrinking Software Attack Surface with WebAssembly & CNCF Wasmcloud - Liam Randall, CosmonicWebAssembly is poised to fundamentally transform the development of both browser and server-side development. The virtualization of the CPU, OS, and cloud with hypervisor, containers, and Kubernetes each marked epochs of technology that ushered in emerging trends in software architecture, design, development, operation, and life cycle management. In this session, we highlight the development and advantages of WebAssembly and the CNCF wasmCloud Application Framework. WebAssembly marks the next wave of cloud-native evolution. In this demonstration heavy session, we highlight 3 main advantages driving the adoption of these technologies focusing on the security impacts: 1. With WebAssembly's virtualization of the application, we demonstrate portability across diverse CPUs, clouds, Kubernetes distributions, edges, and web browsers. 2. Through a capability-driven sandbox we demonstrate a security model that is sandboxed, portable, and consistent across the diverse execution environments. 3. With wasmClouds actor model we demonstrate a streamlined approach to managing the software supply chain by virtualizing the use of non-functional requirements and common open source libraries.                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQVmPbW8h80 | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |
| Lighting Talk: Lessons Learned from Writing Thousands of Lines of IaC - Eran Bibi, Firefly           | Lighting Talk: Lessons Learned from Writing Thousands of Lines of IaC - Eran Bibi, FireflyImmutable architecture is the backbone of infrastructure as code & cloud native operations, to ensure production environments cannot be changed during runtime. While this has the benefits of its inherent safety measures, this can also be restrictive, all while creating new challenges for security. Immutable concepts are much more effective when it comes to securing cloud native environments and infrastructure, which is becoming an increasingly more complex task. This talk will focus on some of the fundamentals of immutable architecture, best practices and recommended design patterns to work around its limitations and enhance security, as well as what you most certainly should not be doing when running immutable architecture both from an infrastructure and security perspective. This will be demonstrated through a real-world example of deploying a single-tenant SaaS in an automated pipeline, typical challenges encountered, and what was learned on the way, through a Terraform, Kubernetes and step functions example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHPy1OBqWc | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |
| Lightning Talk: Repurposed Purpose: Using Git's DAG for Supply Chain Artifact Resolution- Aeva Black | Lightning Talk: Repurposed Purpose: Using Git's DAG for Supply Chain Artifact Resolution - Aeva Black, MicrosoftWhat if we could know the complete and reproducible artifact tree for every binary executable, shared object, container, &etc – including all its dependencies – and you could efficiently cross-reference that against a database of known vulnerabilities? If you had had that information, could you have remediated Log4Shell faster? Might it even help open source maintainers identify at-risk dependencies sooner? If you're thinking, "this sounds too good to be true - what's it going to cost?", then we really hope you’ll join us because we believe this should be an automatic part of open source build tools. In this talk, Aeva and Ed will share why they're so excited about GitBOM and explain what it is (hint: it's not git and it's not an SBOM). If the demo gods are willing, they will show you how you can generate a GitBOM with a simple command-line tool, and explain why you won't have to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SSkNLWL4UM | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |
| Lightning Talk: Knowing Your Serverless Functions: Signing and Verifying Serverless... Ariel Shuper  | Lightning Talk: Knowing Your Serverless Functions: Signing and Verifying Serverless Functions with Cosign - Ariel Shuper, Cisco the security of software supply chains is extremely important. Malicious attacks on the software supply chain are an ever-present threat that can cause extreme damage. An increasing popular method to secure software supply chain is by creating a cryptographic evidence that the author of the code is who they say they are; based on them having access to the trusted private key and the content has not been changed since. Kubernetes provides a great infrastructure to complement code "signing" with a validation step that ensures signing prerequisites where met and only "signed" images are deployed. An admission controller can use ValidationWebHook and MutatingWebHook to verify deployments of "signed" images only. But what about Serverless functions? how can users validate their code was changed/ tempered before or after it was uploaded to their cloud account? In the absence of the admission controller equivalent how users can stay protected? In this talk we'll demostrate how to use and operate code-signing for serverless function using Cosign project and how to validate that only signed functions are being used in the cloud account (leveraging available tools).                                                                         | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAKU917XLU8 | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |

Serverless computing available by a provider permits the execution of a piece of code by dynamically allocating resources and adhere to a consumption based pricing model. These snippets or sections of code are called “functions” and can serve multiple needs as identified in the newly released CNCF Serverless Whitepaper, first available at KubeCon EU 2022. Over the past 6 months the CNCF Security Technology Advisory group has been working on a platform independent whitepaper on serverless security. This whitepaper incorporates the industry experience of STAG members alongside industry standard best practices. Join Ashish Rajan and Andrew Krug for this panel discussion with STAG whitepaper authors. We'll discuss what's changed since the last whitepaper was released and predict a few things about where serverless security is headed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKx6dZ-N1jk | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |

Helping developers and operators build security controls in from day-one with easy to use open source tooling can make that a reality. This workshop will take a hands-on approach to demonstrate how to install, configure and customize open source security tools to be used throughout the DevOps process. The workshop will focus on a couple of core tools. Firstly understanding how Trivy can be used to help secure container images, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests and IaC code such as Terraform.

Executive Order 14028 mandates "significant investments" to help protect against malicious cyber threats and emphasizes a renewed focus on "enhancing software supply chain security," including compliance with the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF). To meet requirements of SSDF, we present a practitioner's guide for the journey ahead employing the Supply Chain Integrity Model (SCIM), an open-source model for managing data about the security, quality, and integrity of assets across end-to-end supply chains. We show how to maximize ROI in software supply chain security, enabling a trusted platform for the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that extends to partners and customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P70z2PmkbxA | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |
| Lightning Talk: lockc - Containing the Containers That Do Not Contain - Michal Rostecki              | Lightning Talk: lockc - Containing the Containers That Do Not Contain - Michal Rostecki, Deepfence Inclockc is open source software for providing MAC (Mandatory Access Control) type of security audit for container workloads, written in Rust in C (soon to be written fully in Rust). The main reason why lockc exists is that containers do not contain. Containers are not as secure and isolated as VMs. By default, they expose a lot of information about host OS and provide ways to "break out" from the container. lockc aims to provide more isolation to containers and make them more secure through policies enforces in the kernel. The main technology behind lockc is eBPF - to be more precise, its ability to attach to LSM hooks. This talk will also mention Aya and the ability to write eBPF programs in Rust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEr9eQLs_n4 | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |

Shauli Rozen | Lightning Talk: What Have We Learned from Scanning Over 10K Unique Clusters with Kubescape? - Shauli Rozen, ARMOKubescape is a K8s open-source tool providing a multi-cloud K8s single pane of glass, including risk analysis, security compliance, RBAC visualizer and image vulnerabilities scanning. Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, detecting misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (such as the NSA-CISA, MITRE ATT&CK®), software vulnerabilities, and RBAC (role-based-access-control) violations at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline, calculates risk score instantly and shows risk trends over time. In the last 6 months, Kubescape scanned over 10K unique clusters and we learned a great deal about the state of Kubernetes risk, compliance, and security vulnerabilities. In this session, Shauli Rozen, ARMO CEO &Co-Founder, will share interesting insight on why and where Kubernetes deployments are failing, the weak spots, and how to get better. He will share some interesting statistics on which controls fail most and where and what are measures to take in order to prevent them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_-lhJW0m8Q | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |
| Real Time Security - eBPF for Preventing attacks - Liz Rice, Isovalent                               | Real Time Security - eBPF for Preventing attacks - Liz Rice, IsovalenteBPF is used in several cloud native security tools. In some respects it is already being used for preventative security: - Cilium uses eBPF to enforce NetworkPolicy - Default seccomp profiles - more properly called seccomp-bpf - limit the system calls that applications can use When it comes to runtime security, Falco today uses eBPF to detect suspicious application behavior, but this isn’t preventative - it generates alerts that are used asynchronously to react to malicious events. Is this really the best we can do with eBPF? The answer is a resounding “no”. In this talk we’ll dive into demos and code to explore how eBPF can be used for the next generation of security enforcement tooling. This talk will cover: - Why enforcing NetworkPolicy with eBPF has been in place for years, but preventative security for applications has taken longer - How Phantom attacks can compromise the use of basic system call hooks - How other eBPF attachment points, such as BPF LSM, can be used for preventative security You don’t need to know about eBPF to get the most out of this talk, but you will need a basic understanding of kernel and user space, and a willingness to see some C code.                                                                                                                         | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs3MBK17kCk | 2022-05-17T20:36:17Z |

| VEX! or... How to Reduce CVE Noise With One Simple Trick! - Frederick Kautz                          | VEX! or... How to Reduce CVE Noise With One Simple Trick! - Frederick KautzCVEs are one of the most valuable tools for determining risk, but they have significant usability issues. Just because you are "vulnerable" to a CVE does not mean you are "affected" by the vulnerability. Small development teams can usually mitigate the risk by having a team member analyze the impact. However, this noise can overwhelm you if you're running a large-scale vulnerability management program with diverse vendors. The lack of context in a CVE directly impacts your capability to rank vulnerabilities and respond to them efficiently. Enter VEX, the Vulnerability-Exploitability eXchange. In this talk, we will cover what VEX is. We will cover how it integrates with SBOMs, and how it can become a critical capability of your Zero Trust infrastructure. If you're a consumer, you can use it to help determine the risk of a vulnerability and how to mitigate the vulnerability with computer-assisted tooling. If you're a vendor, you can use it to communicate actionable information to customers effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWAn3ynhyzQ | 2022-05-19T10:03:04Z |
| Towards the Hardened Cloud-Native Cornerstone: Container Runtime Protection from Secur... Kailun Qin | Towards the Hardened Cloud-Native Cornerstone: Container Runtime Protection from Security to Privacy - Kailun Qin, IntelContainers, the defacto Cloud-Native vehicles carrying complex workloads today, are yet facing increasing threats owing to their weaker threat model and isolation guarantees. The security concerns and mutual distrust over the inter-container relations spread from the network to the system level, even to the intra-container or against Cloud admins and infrastructure. In this talk, we'll start by reviewing attack vectors of the container runtime and revisiting the existing protection such as AppArmor, SELinux, seccomp and their limitations. Next, we’ll deep dive into the most recent advances of enabling kernel-aided (Landlock, Core Scheduling) and hardware-aided (Memory Protection Keys, Trusted Execution Environment) "magic" with containers against more advanced exploits. The adaptations required to the runtime and image specs of containers, also to their policy enforcement, debugging, monitoring, logging, and alerting management will be further discussed. Finally, we’ll share the "Now and next" and the real scenarios of the hardened two-way sandboxes for both security and privacy.                                                                                                                                                               | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3I23EnC5qs | 2022-05-19T14:00:18Z |

Michael Lieberman   | Putting the Supply Chain Pieces together: A Deep Dive into the Secure software Factory - Michael Lieberman, CitiIn this deep dive on supply chain security Michael Lieberman will go into a deep dive on an implementation of the CNCF's Secure Software Factory reference architecture. The talk will discuss the holistic nature of the supply chain security problem space and how the reference architecture highlights the software provenance gap that many projects and organizations trying to improve their security posture have. Michael will show how cloud native tools, configured and implemented in the right ways, can help in providing reliable provenance while increasing the trustworthiness of the artifacts you build. A system built on top of tools like Kyverno, Tekton, Chains, Spire and Sigstore will be shown how they can be tied together to build software that hits high SLSA levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYRycpIJqVs | 2022-05-19T14:00:18Z |

Christophe Tafani-Dereeper | Purple Teaming Like Sky’s the Limit – Adversary Emulation in the Cloud with Stratus Red Team - Christophe Tafani-Dereeper, DatadogEngineering and Security teams are increasingly operating in the cloud. With that comes the need to identify malicious activity in cloud-native environments such as AWS or Kubernetes. In this context, it’s critical that we ask ourselves: what does malicious activity look like in the cloud? What are common attacker and malware tactics we should prioritize detecting? How do we reproduce these against a live cloud environment, in order to validate our logging and threat detection pipelines? In this talk, we’ll present Stratus Red Team: an open-source project for adversary emulation and validation of threat detection in the cloud. We’ll discuss the motivation behind the project, the journey and design decisions behind it, but also the philosophy we stand for: focusing on documenting and emulating real-world, documented, and sighted attack techniques. We’ll conclude by a live demo where we use Stratus Red Team to detonate attack techniques against a live AWS account. https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDJpU4Eh1ms | 2022-05-19T14:00:18Z |

| GitOps As a Journey - Dan Garfield, Codefresh; Scott Rigby, Weaveworks & Chris Short, AWS            | What is GitOps and How to Get It Right - Dan Garfield, Codefresh; Scott Rigby, Weaveworks & Chris Short, AWSThe term "GitOps" goes back to Alexis Richardson's initial blogpost on operations by pull request but over time it became clear that GitOps was poorly understood. At the end of 2020, Amazon, Azure, Codefresh, Github, Redhat, and Weaveworks came together to start the GitOps Working Group. The goal was to work together and invite the community to collaborate on clear principles and definitions around GitOps. In this talk, two Open GitOps Co-Chairs will share how the principles were created, what they mean, and some common misunderstanding about what is and isn't GitOps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQgsxT3SlN8 | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |

Christian Hernandez | Keynote: Everything as Code: Declarative Application Delivery with GitOps Workflows- Christian Hernandez, Red HatModern tools are a key component to building a successful application delivery framework based on the GitOps principles. Combining the advantages of Tekton, ArgoCD, and now StackRox open source projects, deliver security without compromising the quality or speed and encourage security, SRE, and application development teams to get declarative. Join us to see an example framework for what it means to really deliver everything as code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7u-v53BW-o | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |
| 100,000 Different Ways to Manage Secrets in GitOps - Andrew Block, Red Hat                           | 100,000 Different Ways to Manage Secrets in GitOps - Andrew Block, Red HatAny GitOps implementation involves managing a wide range of resources. Sooner rather than later, there will become a need to manage sensitive assets, such as passwords or tokens. So, how can these types of assets be handled appropriately so that they are not visible in plain text when stored in a Git repository? Secrets management is a prevalent topic in the cloud native ecosystem and given its importance, tools and frameworks have been developed that can be applied to not only the content itself, but also within GitOps engines. Understanding where, how and when they can be used could make all the difference when employing proper security measures while implementing a GitOps solution. Attendees will learn: * Tools for detecting the presence of sensitive assets within Git repositories * Strategies for encrypting data at rest * Integrations with purpose built secrets management engines * How sensitive assets can be stored and used when working with public cloud providers * The mechanisms for which GitOps engines can aid in the management of sensitive resources Upon completion, attendees will no longer have an excuse to leave sensitive assets unprotected again!                                                               | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVaaqP7_AJg | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |
| Organizing Teams for GitOps and Cloud Native Deployments - Sandeep Parikh, Google Cloud              | Organizing Teams for GitOps and Cloud Native Deployments - Sandeep Parikh, Google CloudLarge scale Cloud Native deployments typically include multiple teams running multiple applications across multiple environments - but how should teams be organized to enable efficient software delivery? How should responsibilities be split between platform, DevOps, and application teams? In this talk we’ll walk through the different approaches teams can adopt for organizing Git repos, handling upstream dependencies, and managing software rollouts. This talk will go in-depth about repo structure and strategies for managing the release process, as well as how to enforce policies across configs and manifests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl4-f1d_viY | 2022-05-17T22:42:47Z |
| Lightning Talk: Hiding in Plain Sight - How Flux Decrypts Secrets - Somtochi Onyekwere, Weaveworks   | Lightning Talk: Hiding in Plain Sight - How Flux Decrypts Secrets - Somtochi Onyekwere, WeaveworksGitOps has been all the rage of late and it requires you to store all your YAML files in Git. This works great for YAMLs containing non-sensitive information but it gets trickier for files that contain secrets even if the repository is secret. Anyone who has or gains access to your repository can access your secret, which could include database passwords and API keys. This talk explores how Flux, with the help of projects such as Mozilla SOPS and sealed secrets, lets you encrypt your secrets and then store them as files in Git. Then, it decrypts them for you and applies them to the cluster. Flux also lets you use key management systems (KMS) in the major cloud providers so you don’t have to create the secret containing your private key in the cluster. The talk will end with a showcase of this feature in Flux using live demos and practical examples. These tools and techniques will help users to benefit from GitOps with the added security that Flux brings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rJur5VE6yA | 2022-05-17T22:42:47Z |

Pietro Terrizzi | Lightning Talk: Day 2 Has Arrived - How Carvel Suite and Cluster API Can Bring GitOps to Your Kubernetes Infrastructure - Pietro Terrizzi, CLASTIX srlKubernetes has emerged as the de-facto standard for cloud and container orchestration, thanks to its composability and extensibility; however, these positives don't come without a cost. While setting up a cluster as compositions of YAML manifests may seem like a challenge at hand, managing and upgrading a fleet across multiple environments and distributions could seriously become hell. In this talk, we will discover how to maintain and upgrade the state of an infrastructure deployed through the Cluster API, a Kubernetes SIG project based on kubeadm that aims to extend k8s core capabilities through a configuration-as-code. Then, we’ll see how this methodology can be empowered by the Carvel suite, a composable toolchain that makes use of a declarative and layered approach for application building, configuration and deployment, in order to reduce the toil of cluster day 2 operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kuEEsQFCOg | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |
| Intuitive Progressive Delivery Across Microservices in a Depe... Hari Kumar Rongali & Rohit Agrawal  | Intuitive Progressive Delivery Across Microservices in a Dependency Graph Using Argo Rollouts. - Hari Kumar Rongali, Intuit & Rohit Agrawal, DataBricksProgressive Delivery as you all know is controlled deployments to minimize the risk associated with service updates. Organizations use tools like ArgoRollouts to achieve Progressive delivery for individual services. Progressive delivery across microservices with dependencies is a challenge that many companies are working to solve. In this session, We will demonstrate how to use Argo Rollouts in achieving progressive rollouts & automated rollbacks across microservices in a dependency graph using capabilities such as automated analysis & custom webhook notifications. We will also discuss how to use your current complex multi-service monitoring queries in analysis and automate the entire deployment flow across microservices. Another important capability that we will present is ‘dry runs’ that will enable users to identify and validate possible automated rollbacks in production without actually doing rollbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02y5q4Cc2Fs | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |

| Applied GitOps with Argo CD Autopilot Using Multiple Clusters with an Appli... Hannah Grace Seligson | Applied GitOps with Argo CD Autopilot Using Multiple Clusters with an ApplicationSet - Hannah Grace Seligson, CodefreshUsing a GitOps controller, such as ArgoCD, to deploy applications allows you to deploy more often, execute rollbacks, and avoid configuration drift. However, what if you are an organization beginning to adopt GitOps and are new to Argo? What if you need to deploy hundreds of applications? Manage several clusters? How do you structure your directory? Or apply GitOps at scale for your organization? You can do all of this with Argo CD Autopilot, which provides an opinionated directory structure, allowing you to promote changes across environments with an ApplicationSet Controller for Argo CD applied by the Autopilot bootstrap. Autopilot enables organizations to simplify disaster recovery and quickly set up one-off environments or easily promote changes by leveraging GitOps. This tool works well for teams that are new to Argo CD but want to enable the ApplicationSet's automation and templating abilities to create, modify, and manage multiple applications simultaneously while also targeting numerous clusters with a no-brainer directory structure.                                                                                                                                         | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3k2qI2NDsA | 2022-05-17T22:42:47Z |
| Lightning Talk: GitOps, A Slightly Realistic Situation on Kuberne... Laurent Grangeau & Ludovic Piot | Lightning Talk: GitOps, A Slightly Realistic Situation on Kubernetes with Flux - Laurent Grangeau, Google & Ludovic Piot, theGarageBandOfITYou're tired of talks that deploy hello-worlds to demonstrate the relevance of the younameit tool. That's good news: what we're interested in is trying out a slightly realistic DevSecOps situation. So we're going to build a step-by-step enterprise scenario where devs and ops collaborate on a daily basis around a GitOps workflow based on Kubernetes and Flux. The dev teams deploy / update / rollback Pokémon WebApps using Kustomize and/or Helm charts. On the Ops side, we take care of the platform's security issues by implementing Kyverno: segregation of team rights, WebApps network flows and control of activities on the cluster. And we monitor everything via Prometheus and Grafana. Finally, we will see how to articulate upgrade and configuration while respecting the blue/green pattern and canary deployment, thanks to Istio. At the end of this hands-on, you may have discovered some technologies. But above all you will have seen how to implement them in a dev-to-prod process that resembles a real case.                                                                                                                                                                  | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU-zbTgbHPI | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |
| When GitOps Meets UX - Cansu Kavili Örnek & Angels Dimitri Gutierrez, Red Hat                        | When GitOps Meets UX - Cansu Kavili Örnek & Angels Dimitri Gutierrez, Red HatWe had the ambition to create a sustainable platform to support development, lower the cognitive load of onboarding new applications and teams, and increase the products' visibility while giving developers the freedom to experiment. Sounds like a lot of work, right? Yet GitOps provided us fast and fine solutions for processes like self-service or onboarding! But that required some design considerations and a strong relationship between platform and developers. And that's where UX comes in!Join us to talk about how to combine tech and UX practices to bring the best out of GitOps and create a state-of-the-art platform focusing on DevEx! Together we’ll address questions like:*What are the benefits of working techies and UX together?*How can we validate the ideas and merge them with devs feedback to create platform features and implement them through GitOps?*How to simplify GitOps and make it accessible?*How can we empower devs to own the approach and encourage them to contribute?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0LiBEecJVE | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |
| Crossing the Divide: How GitOps Brought AppDev & Platform Teams Together! - Priyanka "Pinky" Ravi    | Crossing the Divide: How GitOps Brought AppDev & Platform Teams Together! - Priyanka "Pinky" Ravi, WeaveworksPriyanka, now at Weaveworks, and Russ, her former colleague at State Farm will share their varied experiences of application change management and how they updated their process to follow the GitOps methodology. Together, they will emphasize the benefits of adopting GitOps by commiserating on the elaborate difficulties and contorted solutions of earlier alternative deployment strategies. Priyanka and Russ come from different sides of the Application / Platform development team divide, and each bring their own historical context and separate understanding of how a deployment system should function! Be prepared to hear horror stories and tales about those systems that should never be told, about the worst solutions that should never have been built, and problems that should never have needed to be solved - and what it looks like on the other side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jNtDnWT3yo | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |
| Infrastructure as Software with GitOps - Justin Garrison, Amazon                                     | Infrastructure as Software with GitOps - Justin Garrison, AmazonThe cloud has enabled abstractions and automation, but Infrastructure as Code (IaC) doesn't scale. You can use declarative YAML or imperative scripts and still lose control. Infrastructure as Software (IaS) allows you to control and scale infrastructure with the same practices as applications. GitOps is an implementation of IaS with lots of benefits over IaC. We'll look at how it's different, when you should use it, and where it potentially breaks down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hULomz2FU40 | 2022-05-17T22:36:06Z |

| GitOps Everything!? We Sure Can!, Ayelet de-Roos, AppsFlyer                                          | GitOps Everything!? We Sure Can!, Ayelet de-Roos, AppsFlyerUsually when developers mention GitOps, it is to describe yet another continuous delivery mechanism for their (micro-)services. There are developers that to some extent apply it to their infrastructure, but can it describe both? Can you also apply it to your SaaS solutions? At Appsflyer, with an architecture of over 850 micro-services, thousands of cloud resources and dozens of SaaS integrations, we strive to automate them all using GitOps workflow. In this talk, Ayelet de-Roos will present how AppsFlyer applies Terraform with GitOps to automate everything, how AppsFlyer keeps its deployables safe and easy to manage with Flux CD, how AppsFlyer identifies drifts in non-Kubernetes environments, and how to enforce company standards and policies using Open Policy Agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGQyGuoS5Ds | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Managing Thousands of Clusters and Their Workloads with Flux - Max Jonas Werner, D2iQ                | Managing Thousands of Clusters and Their Workloads with Flux - Max Jonas Werner, D2iQWith Kubernetes becoming more and more popular, so is managing clusters at scale. Applying GitOps principles with Flux simplifies provisioning clusters and managing workloads deployed onto them, including tenant and RBAC management. In this session I will demonstre a best practice approach towards GitOps with a management cluster handling the provisioning and further maintenance of clusters, tenants and workloads, employing the CNCF projects Flux, OPA Gatekeeper and the Kubernetes Cluster API sub-project. The benefits of such an approach are: * It creates a simplified way to declaratively define thousands of clusters and perform operations on those clusters * Makes it easy to have a multi-tenancy approach where each team or group of applications gets their own cluster or individual namespace on a certain cluster * Operations against clusters are fully audited and attributable, as reverting changes is hard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xei2ZcEg5B0 | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Solving Environment Promotion with Flux - Sam Tavakoli & Adelina Simion, Form3                       | Solving Environment Promotion with Flux - Sam Tavakoli & Adelina Simion, Form3Without a doubt, Flux is now one of the most popular tools for GitOps. Form3 have been using Flux extensively for PR based operations of our Kubernetes clusters, which has resulted in a great developer experience for their growing engineering teams. However, Flux Kustomize overlays have proven insufficient for Form3's complex business needs, which involve multi-cloud workloads and controlled releases between environments. As a result, the Tooling team at Form3 have written their own tool, k8s-promoter. It automates the promotion of workloads by creating pull requests which copy manifests to the target cluster. Then, Flux reconciles manifests from the directory structure and correctly promotes workloads. This talk will cover: - How the typical commit/deploy flow at Form3 looks, as well as how they use GitOps - Why the tooling Team have decided to use promotion via duplication - Architecture and design details of k8s-promoter - A demo of the deploy flow using k8s-promoter - Lessons learned and future improvements for the project Join this talk to learn from the journey of solving the problem of environment promotion at Form3!                                                                                              | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqs4mVppn1Q | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Creating A Landlord for Multi-tenant K8s Using Flux, Gatekeeper, Helm, and Friends - Michael Irwin   | Creating A Landlord for Multi-tenant K8s Using Flux, Gatekeeper, Helm, and Friends - Michael Irwin, DockerSupporting multi-tenant environments in Kubernetes is easy, right? (insert laugh here) Well, it can be. But, it takes organization, structure, and proper policy enforcement.At Virginia Tech, I helped build a "Common Application Platform" that gives each tenant its own manifest repo and deploys those manifests into isolated namespaces using Flux. By leveraging Gatekeeper and Karpenter, we can properly isolate workloads into node pools and ensure tenants don't step on each other's toes. And best of all, our tenant config is in a simple Helm chart that we call "the landlord."In this talk, we'll dive into how we've built the landlord, the various policies and mutations we're using, and how it works... all with the intent that you can build your own platform too! We'll have live demos and even try to break a thing or two!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agsnktpIxzU | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Lightning Talk: A Practitioners Guide to GitOps - Introduction, Principles, and Im... Thomas Schuetz | Lightning Talk: A Practitioners Guide to GitOps - Introduction, Principles, and Implementation in Keptn - Thomas Schuetz, Dynatrace Not so long ago, we had to remember lots of commands and their execution order to configure systems and infrastructure. With the rise of Kubernetes and Infrastructure-as-Code, we learned that it's easier to declare the desired state of systems and let other tools bring our intentions to the system. Finally, Git can be our best friend when it comes to storing and versioning our configuration.To put it to practice we look at one specific GitOps implementation approach from the CNCF Sandbox Project Keptn. Together we walk through declaring the desired state for application delivery in Git, see how the GitOps operator translates that definition into tasks and how those tasks get executed by various tools to bring the desired state to life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3E5o3SG51A | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Implementing Preview Environments with GitOps in Kubernetes - François Le Pape, Remazing             | Implementing Preview Environments with GitOps in Kubernetes - François Le Pape, RemazingImplementing Preview Environments with GitOps in Kubernetes: how to spin up ephemeral environments on the fly at each Pull-requests for the delight of your team. Have you ever experienced a delayed-release because your Staging environment was broken by another feature? Ending up merging a non-production tested Hotfix branch to your Main branch? Preview environments are an answer to increasing velocity inside your team. Kubernetes combined with GitOps allow you to quickly create and destroy resources along with keeping a clear code history and infrastructure changes in Git. Using Bitbucket Pipelines for Continuous Integration and ArgoCD for declarative Continuous Delivery, we will go through different challenges you can encounter to deploy Preview environments such as Secrets management with Sealed Secrets, splitting repositories, and clearing resources to prevent further costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNAiIJRIVWA | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Lightning Talk: Taming the Thundering Gitops Herd with Update... Joaquim Rocha & Iago López Galeiras | Lightning Talk: Taming the Thundering Gitops Herd with Update Policies - Joaquim Rocha & Iago López Galeiras, Microsoftgitops in Kubernetes is a simple but powerful workflow: declare the deployments' desired state in git and an agent (often Flux) should pick it up and reflect the state in the cluster automatically. However, this approach allows for the propagation of issues by "broken" versions of software, which could be avoided with a progressive rollout and enforcement of policies around those. In this talk we propose the use of an update and policy manager – Nebraska – as a complement to gitops. Nebraska allows to set up policies to be met for granting updates, and aggregates the data about update statuses. The integration is accomplished using a new Nebraska Update Agent (NUA), which controls Flux itself, automatically reports statuses, and has a minimal impact to the gitops users’ workflows. With NUA and flux, users can manage new deployment rollouts in a more controlled way, by defining policies for updates, for example: update just one cluster at a time and halt all updates if one cluster fails to update; update cluster only during certain hours; see a global view of the updates’ statuses and drill down to any error reports. Hence, tying gitops and policy-based updates in Kubernetes. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20f6yYK-RWM | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Lightning Talk: How Intuit Enables GitOps at Scale For All Its Developers - Omer Azmon, Intuit       | Lightning Talk: How Intuit Enables GitOps at Scale For All Its Developers - Omer Azmon, IntuitThis is the story of how we at Intuit learned what it really takes to enable our front-end, back-end, and AI developers – all our developers – to rapidly create, update, and dispose of applications. Our learning from building such a GitOps on-boarding/asset-management system include: * What are the independent personas whose needs must be addressed by any such system, and how to resolve their disparate needs. * What are and how to handle the overlapping needs of the assortment of application types: service, serverless, UI, ML, etc.. * Why is updating and cleanup harder than onboarding * Why workflows, orchestration, and even traditional choreography can't handle the variability of such a system, and what we did about it. * How to avoid flurries of PRs. * What happens when a developer can rapidly standup an asset and abandon when not needed like cattle, including build, deploy, persistence, everything * Why is it impossible for one team to develop this alone, and how to make it possible to deliver such a system. We hope that you will find the needs common and join us in building an open source community based on our proven tools.                                                                         | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohx2rdjpFA0 | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| GitOps Based Infrastructure as Code with Rancher Fleet and Crossplane - Hossein Salahi, Liquid Reply | GitOps Based Infrastructure as Code with Rancher Fleet and Crossplane - Hossein Salahi, Liquid ReplyWith more demand for deploying at scale, we need a new concept for multi-cluster management. The majority of current multi-cluster and multi-cloud management solutions are missing a unified control plane not only to manage Kubernetes cluster life cycle (vanilla or managed), but also application deployment, security policies enforcement (e.g., RBAC, network policies, etc.). By using GitOps patterns we can solve most of the above-mentioned challenges. Fleet is the next generation of cluster management tooling and uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage GitOps at scale up to deployments of thousands of clusters. Crossplane, on the other hand is a cloud control plane that transforms Kubernetes API into an interface to the public or private cloud providers. The Crossplane fits really well into the Gitops realm, since it allows declarative specifications of cloud services that are stored in a git repository for GitOps tools to pull from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD5onzZBXj4 | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |

Now Let’s Try Something Completely Different -Eliran Bivas, AppsFlyerAt Appsflyer, we have 400 engineers that write software in several programming languages and with an architecture of over 850 micro-services, thousands of cloud resources and dozens of SaaS integrations. We felt a change was needed. Can GitOps be that change? In this talk, Eliran Bivas, AppsFlyer's Cloud Native Leader, will present the challenges the department faced and still faces when adopting GitOps practices. How AppsFlyer’s Engineering Platform organization changed, how AppsFlyer uncovered the unknowns, and how AppsFlyer educated its Platform Group, and later the entire R&D organization to practice GitOps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es5ngkzJDEc | 2022-05-18T22:18:27Z |
| Lightning Talk: Exploring HashiCorp Vault and ArgoCD - the GitOps Way - Tracy P Holmes, Codefresh    | Lightning Talk: Exploring HashiCorp Vault and ArgoCD - the GitOps Way - Tracy P Holmes, CodefreshA big topic in GitOps that isn't really discussed enough is proper GitOps secrets management and just how serious of an issue it can be in a cloud-native aspect. While normalized usage of Bitnami Sealed Secrets is typically explored, but not much is seen around using HashiCorp Vault. Especially as it pertains to using Vault with Argo Project's continuous delivery tool Argo CD. What exactly is HashiCorp Vault? HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management tool created primarily to control access to sensitive credentials in a low-trust environment. It can be used to manage secrets, encryption as a service, and privileged access. This talk will explore integrating HashiCorp Vault with Argo CD, any pros and cons, and (hopefully) what ended up working for Tracy and her sensitive credentials. Note: A shorter version of this talk was presented at HashiTalks 2022. However, the intent is to go more in-depth with exploration and findings while attempting the integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2camnnjyviw | 2022-05-18T22:19:54Z |
